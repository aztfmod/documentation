# Rover commands

## Commonly used commands

Beyond a container, rover is your one-stop tool to help on landing zone and landing zones state management. 

What people love about rover is the ubiquity it gives them and seamless transition from local development environment with pipelines. In this articles, you will find the most commonly used commands for rover and some details on the state locator process.

Rover is by nature multi-subscription, and in landing zones worlds, the subscription where you want to deploy your resource is just another parameter of rover, just as the subscription where to store the state files and locate the launchpad.


## Login

The first command you will have to run is ```rover login```:

You can run a plain rover login:

```bash
rover login
```

You can specify additional context to restrict the token, like the tenant name and subscription to use:

```bash
rover login --tenant [tenant_name.onmicrosoft.com or tenant_guid (optional)] --subscription [subscription_id_to_target(optional)]
```

You can log out running the following command:

```bash
rover logout
```

## Landing zones commands

Once authentication is completed, a typical rover command looks like:

```bash
rover \
 -lz /tf/caf/landingzones/caf_launchpad \
 -var-folder /tf/caf/configuration/contoso/platform/level0/launchpad \
 -tfstate_subscription_id a-b-c-d-e \
 -target_subscription f-g-h-i \
 -tfstate caf_launchpad.tfstate \
 -log-severity ERROR \
 -launchpad \
 -env contoso \
 -level level0 \
 -p ${TF_DATA_DIR}/caf_launchpad.tfstate.tfplan \
 -a plan
```

The following table summarizes the most common parameters and their default values:

## Examples

### untaint

When a resource has been marked as tainted and you want to untaint it.

```shell
# module.solution.module.storage_containers["storageWorkspace_di001"].azurerm_storage_container.stg is tainted, so must be replaced
+/- resource "azurerm_storage_container" "stg" {
      ~ has_immutability_policy = false -> (known after apply)
      ~ has_legal_hold          = false -> (known after apply)
      ~ id                      = "https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.blob.core.windows.net/di001" -> (known after apply)
      ~ metadata                = {} -> (known after apply)
        name                    = "di001"
      ~ resource_manager_id     = "/subscriptions/000000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/cont-rg-data-landing-zone-storage-lqi/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/blobServices/default/containers/di001" -> (known after apply)
        # (2 unchanged attributes hidden)
    }
```

You need to extract the terraform resource. In our example:

```shell
module.solution.module.storage_containers["storageWorkspace_di001"].azurerm_storage_container.stg
```

and run the following rover command. You need to wrap the resource under double quotes and escape the quotes in the square brakets.

```bash 
rover \
  --impersonate-sp-from-keyvault-url https://cont-kv-scl-xxx.vault.azure.net/ \  // Remove this line if you are not using service principals
  -lz /tf/caf/landingzones/caf_solution \
  -tfstate_subscription_id 000000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
  -target_subscription 000000000-0000-00000-00000000 \
  -tfstate data-landing-zone_prod_level3.tfstate \
  -env contoso \
  -level level3 \
  -w data-landing-zone-prod `\
  -p ${TF_DATA_DIR}/data-landing-zone_prod_level3.tfstate.tfplan \
  -a untaint "module.solution.module.storage_containers[\"storageWorkspace_di001\"].azurerm_storage_container.stg" 
  ```

When executed the rover will display a similar output.

```shell
Terraform has been successfully initialized!
Terraform init return code 0
@calling other
running terraform untaint -state=/home/vscode/.terraform.cache/contoso/rover_jobs/20220316003626962686570/tfstates/level3/data-landing-zone-prod/data-landing-zone_prod_level3.tfstate  module.solution.module.storage_containers["storageWorkspace_di001"].azurerm_storage_container.stg
Resource instance module.solution.module.storage_containers["storageWorkspace_di001"].azurerm_storage_container.stg has been successfully untainted.
Terraform untaint return code: 0
```

## Workspace management

In the previous section, workspace is used as a argument to specify where to place the tfstate (in-lieu of the default ```tfstate``` container inside the storage account), rover workspace can be used as a command to manage workspaces:

Create a workspace:

```bash
rover workspace create application-workspace -level level1 -env contoso-sandpit
```

Delete a workspace:

```bash
rover workspace delete application-workspace -level level1 -env contoso-sandpit
```

List all workspaces for a level in an environment:

```bash
rover workspace list -level level1 -env contoso-sandpit
```

:::note
Although this is possible to create the workspace containers with rover, we recommend you create and manage them via Terraform code.

<!-- ## State locator details

Rover offers you to manage state and operations on Azure Terraform SRE landing zones. It allows you to do commands on storage accounts deployed by launchpad various levels.

We retrieve the state files using the following tags on storage accounts and Key Vault: -->
