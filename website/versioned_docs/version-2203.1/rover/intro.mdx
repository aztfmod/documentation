# Introduction to the CAF rover

<ReactPlayer controls url='https://www.youtube.com/embed/2px14Zajr0k' />

## What is CAF rover?

Although as a first approach it might seem more natural and simple to use Terraform on your laptop, the CAF **rover** is helping you managing your Terraform deployments on Microsoft Azure and has two dimensions:

* **A container**

  * Allows consistent developer experience on PC, Mac, Linux, including the right tools, git hooks and DevOps tools.
  * Native integration with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers), [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
  * Contains the versioned tool set you need to apply landing zones.
  * Helps you switching components versions fast by separating the run environment and the configuration environment.
  * Ensure pipeline ubiquity and abstraction run the rover everywhere, whichever pipeline technology.

* **A Terraform wrapper**

  * Helps you store and retrieve Terraform state files transparently on Azure storage account.
  * Facilitates the transition to CI/CD.
  * Enables seamless experience (state connection, execution traces, etc.) locally and inside pipelines.

## Why using CAF rover?

* Greatly simplifies secure state management on Azure storage accounts.
* Helps testing different versions of binaries (new version of Terraform, Azure CLI, jq, tflint etc.)
* Ubiquitous development environment: everyone works with the same versions of the DevOps toolchain, always up-to-date, running on laptop, pipelines, GitHub Codespaces, etc.
* Facilitates the identity transition to any CI/CD: namely all CI/CD have container capabilities.
* Allows easy transition from one DevOps environment to another (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, CircleCI etc.)
* It's open-source and leveraging open-source projects that you often need with Terraform.

## Where to find CAF rover?

It's an open-source project and you can find stable or preview builds directly from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=aztfmod&type=image), or create your own, to match your organization's own DevOps toolkit. You can find the [rover project here](https://github.com/aztfmod/rover).

## Do I have to use rover?

Nope, you can use all the tools here separately, but it means you will have to do manually everything rover does :)

## How to use CAF rover?

Rover is already included in development environment for Azure Terraform SRE (the ```.devcontainer``` folder in the various projects).
