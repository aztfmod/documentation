# Setup your organization


## Organize your private repository

The first step is create a private repository in your current organization. It has to be a git repository.

The video below shows you how to setup a private GitHub repository you are going to use to store the configuration of your platform landing zones.

<ReactPlayer controls url='https://youtu.be/1tbXXOM1s-o' />

### Clone the platform starter repository

The platform starter project is an empty environment that get you started with your initial configuration files and create a coherent stack.

The [platform starter project is here](https://github.com/Azure/caf-terraform-landingzones-platform-starter). 

If you are using it from GitHub, you can directly select "Use this template", once created you can clone it locally or open it in GitHub Codespace (use the tabs in the following section to get the steps for the desired method.)

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Locally" label="Locally" default>

```bash
# Adjust the name of your organization and repository
git clone git://github.com/<org>/<repo> contoso && cd contoso
```

You should observe:

```bash
Cloning into 'contoso'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 429, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (429/429), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (320/320), done.
remote: Total 429 (delta 110), reused 307 (delta 77), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (429/429), 2.93 MiB | 1.52 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (110/110), done.
```

Open Visual Studio Code from the contoso folder

```bash
code .
```

Trust the repository

### Visual Studio code

Visual Studio code should open your cloned repository and display the following structure.

### Add remote development extension

Select the **Remote - Containers** extension and click Install.

### Re-open vscode in the dev container

Click on the green bottom left button
From the menu select the option

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Codespace" label="Codespace">

Once you have created your repo, create the Codespace:

The Codespace is being instantiated:

And you are ready to go:

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


You should now see the following terminal. This terminal is where you will run all terminal commands described in this on-boarding tutorial.

### Go to the landingzones folder
```bash
# Go to the landingzones folder
➜  caf git:(main) ✗ cd landingzones 

# Note all folders are starting with /tf/caf in the devcontainers. 
➜  landingzones git:(main) ✗ pwd
/tf/caf/landingzones
➜  landingzones git:(main) ✗ 
```

### Switch to the selected landingzones tag 

Latest features on CAF Terraform landingzones repository are released on regular basis. In order to align the deployment instructions, you need to make sure the Terraform code is also using the correct branch or tag.Please check the latest tag from the landingzones repo at https://github.com/Azure/caf-terraform-landingzones/releases .

![](repo-tag.png)

From the terminal, run the following command to checkout to the latest tag: 

As, when we are updating the doc, latest tag available is 2203.2.
Please note that version in the above screenshot may differ.

```bash
git checkout 2203.2

Note: switching to '2203.2'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
```

:::note
The detached head is expected as your are getting to a tag (release version) and not into a branch.

Go to the next step to choose your scenario!
